# Presses

There are 5 different presses in AE2, though their role in this pack is very different from the default.

<Row>

## Processor Presses

In the default AE2 experience, the Silicon, Logic, Calculation, and Engineering Presses are required to create [processors](processors.md) using the <ItemLink id="inscriber" />.  

In this pack, however, **presses are not used for crafting processors**. Instead, all processor creation has been moved to the **Circuit Fabricator multiblock**.  
This structure handles processor production directly without requiring presses.  

That said, a <ItemLink id="mysterious_cube" /> is still required to build the Circuit Fabricator and allow it to function.
