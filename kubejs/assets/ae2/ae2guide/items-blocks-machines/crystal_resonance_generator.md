# The Crystal Resonance Generator

<BlockImage id="crystal_resonance_generator" scale="8" />

This device generates energy for your ME network without the need for fuel. Because of the crystal vibrations this device generates, only one can be used in each network. These vibrations even pass through <ItemLink id="quartz_fiber" />.

**Generation Rate:** <ae2:ConfigValue name="crystalResonanceGeneratorRate"/> AE/t

## Crafting

The Crystal Resonance Generator is not obtained through a standard crafting recipe.  
Instead, it must be **crafted in the World Engine** once you have obtained the **Basic Machine Block Upgrade**.
Please refer to JEI for the exact ingredients.  

Refer to the [World Engine guide](../world-engine.md) for details on unlocking and using this powerful crafting system.
