# Meteorites

<GameScene zoom="4" background="transparent">
  <ImportStructure src="../assets/assemblies/meteor_interior.snbt" />
</GameScene>

In this pack, **meteorites are disabled**. Instead of falling from the sky, the materials you would normally find inside them have been redistributed across the world.

## Obtaining Skystone

Skystone can be found inside **Teleportation Portals** that appear in all four cardinal directions from your base within each ring.  
It can also be located in the **Void Chasm**, the final outer ring.

## Presses and the Mysterious Cube

The [Inscriber Presses](../items-blocks-machines/inscriber_press.md) and the <ItemLink id="mysterious_cube" /> are not hidden inside meteorites.  
Instead, they can be:

- **Purchased from the in-game shop**, or  
- **Traded from the Wandering Trader** when available.

## Getting Started

Once you have gathered Skystone, presses, and a mysterious cube, continue with [Getting Started](../getting-started.md) for guidance on building your first ME system.
